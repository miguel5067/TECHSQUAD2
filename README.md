==TECHSQUAD2 TEAM==

This repository contains engineering materials of a self-driven vehicle's model participating in the WRO Future Engineers competition in the season 2024.
This repository collects the information developed during our team's participation in WRO 2024.

## Introduction

Hello! We are Teachsquad2, composed of Miguel SÃ¡nchez, Oliver Alfonso, Carlos Yauge.  We represent the category of Future Engineers. This team is an olibots.
With an Arduino Mega based board. It incorporates 1 servomotors, 2 ultrasonic, 1 motors. We designed the robot to avoid and overcome obstacles on the track. 
We use the ultrasonic sensor and a camera for the robot to detect distance and colors, allowing turns (red = right, green = left).
