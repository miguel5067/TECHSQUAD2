## Introduction

Hello! We are Teachsquad2, composed of Miguel Sánchez, Oliver Alfonso, Carlos Yauge.  We represent the category of Future Engineers. This team is an olibots.
With an Arduino Mega based board. It incorporates 1 servomotors, 2 ultrasonic, 1 motors. We designed the robot to avoid and overcome obstacles on the track. We use the ultrasonic sensor and a camera for the robot to detect distance and colors, allowing turns (red = right, green = left).
